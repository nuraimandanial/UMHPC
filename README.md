## Introduction üìñ
<p align="justify">The ability to solve complicated problems that require broad skills and extensive computational experimentation has been made possible by modern scientific cooperation. These investigations require the use of particular computing platforms to carry out a series of processing stages, or tasks.</p>
 
<p align="justify">An HPC cluster is similar to a regular computer, but much more powerful because calculations are carried out simultaneously over numerous computing nodes. Users submit their calculations, known as jobs, by logging in from their PCs to the HPC cluster login node using the SSH program or a web browser.</p>
 
<p align="justify">An extracted log refers to a log file that has been pulled or extracted from a source, such as a server or application, for the purpose of analysis. Log files can be used for security, monitoring, and troubleshooting since they include information on a system's operations and activities. Utilizing a variety of tools and methods, extracted logs can be examined to learn more about system performance, user behavior, and potential problems.</p>

### Codes Taken into Implementation
<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116857873/215643360-85d3d879-f572-4e95-8a01-6d94cc1eb1e7.png" height="80%" width="80%">

From the extracted variables from the `extracted_log` file, the yellow highlighted variables were taken as to implement all metrics into one source codes.

## Source Codes üìÇ
<p align="center">The source codes for this project can be found in the following repository: <a href="/OCC9-10/src/Assignment/UMHPC">link to repository</a></p>

- <a href="/OCC9-10/src/Assignment/UMHPC/UMHPC.java">UMHPC.java</a> functioned as the main class for output inside the Netbeans terminal.
- <a href="/OCC9-10/src/Assignment/UMHPC/UMHPC_Interface.java">UMHPC_Interface.java</a> functioned as the main class for output in GUI style.

## Conclusions üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- Adaptability to new applications (<a href="https://netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>) presented a challenge for the project accomplishment.
- Accessibility was difficult due to group members being located off campus
- Time constraints made it hard to study important information and have group discussions
- Despite these challenges, we are able to make progress in learning and utilizing the Slurm workload manager
- We should also focus on collaborating remotely and utilizing online communication tools to stay connected and productive.
- Further training and support may be necessary to fully utilize the capabilities of Slurm workload manager and the related applications.
- We should also identify and prioritize the most important tasks to make the best use of time and resources.
